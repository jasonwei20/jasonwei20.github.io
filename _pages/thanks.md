The following people profoundly influenced me (among others).

* Danny Hermes introduced me to the world of software. He's highest-performing programmer I've worked with and also a role model as a person. 
* Clara Meister is an exemplary researcher in many respects including communication, problem-solving ability, and interdisciplinary research.
* Ryan Cotterell introduced me to linguistics. He challenges me to think differently, and his love of learning inspires me.
* I aim to have the charisma of Ellie Pavlick.
* Quoc Le inspires me to dream big and work hard. 

<!-- And thank you to my high school teachers: Michael Auerbach, Ashley Jones, and Duncan Forbes. -->
